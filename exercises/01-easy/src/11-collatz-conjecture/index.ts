/**
 * The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:
 *
 * Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.
 *
 * Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:
 *
 *     0. 12
 *     1. 6
 *     2. 3
 *     3. 10
 *     4. 5
 *     5. 16
 *     6. 8
 *     7. 4
 *     8. 2
 *     9. 1
 *
 * Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.
